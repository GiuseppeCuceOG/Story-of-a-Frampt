		<p>The Panther is dangerously starving and It needs feeding itself quickly, it can't remember what happened and why It is so weak, however there's no time to think, It is time to act, walking a bit thankfully It found some food! on his right there is a dead body deer, a bit smelling but enough to get better health, on his left not really far a lot of colorful mushrooms, What do you choose to eat? The &ldquo;DEER&rdquo; or &ldquo;MUSHROOMS&rdquo;?</p>

		<p>Well done, You can carry on, but it seems another problem you have, in front of you there are several baby rhino and the mother from far has seen you and charged you! there's no much time you need to find a solution, thankfully the forest is full of branches and trees maybe you can escape through them, but it might be a issue since the Mum Rhino is really running fast, it may make a disaster with the impact, so you also can decide to run as fast as you can and hoping being lucky</p>

		<p>Then He reached a strange place, completely different from the left one, the atmosphere and the air is strange here, and not friendly at all, the breath is getting heavier not just for the running, the heartbeat increase, it is something hardly manageable, you do better run like before if you don't want to get effects from this place, but remember that skills required a lot of energy and remaining weak in the wild is highly risky</p>

		<p>What is your choice? RUN or STAY and try to manage it?</p>
