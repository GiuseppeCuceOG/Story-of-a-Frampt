		<p>The Panther is dangerously starving and It needs feeding itself quickly, it can't remember what happened and why It is so weak, however there's no time to think, It is time to act, walking a bit thankfully It found some food! on his right there is a dead body deer, a bit smelling but enough to get better health, on his left not really far a lot of colorful mushrooms, What do you choose to eat? The DEER or MUSHROOMS?</p>
